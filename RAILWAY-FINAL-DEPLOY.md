# Lunao Railway Deployment - COMPLETE STEP-BY-STEP

## Architecture Summary

```
Railway (1 Service + 1 Database + 1 Volume)
├── Express API Server (serves: /api/* + /dist/* + /sites/*)
├── PostgreSQL Database (bookings, campaigns, SMS logs, credits, chat)
└── Persistent Volume /data (compiled sites survive restarts)

External Services:
├── Cloudflare Pages (site hosting - ALREADY LIVE)
├── Telnyx (SMS sending - ALREADY CONFIGURED)
├── Anthropic (AI code editor - optional)
└── Gemini (chatbot - optional)
```

## RAILWAY SETUP (Step by Step)

### STEP 1: Create Railway Project

1. Go to **https://railway.app** → Click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Search for **"lunaosite"** → Select it
4. Railway will auto-detect `nixpacks.toml` and start building

### STEP 2: Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project dashboard, click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"Database"** → **"PostgreSQL"**
3. Railway creates it instantly
4. **DATABASE_URL** is automatically injected into your app service's environment

### STEP 3: Mount Persistent Volume (for compiled sites)

1. Click your **app service** → **Settings** → **Volumes**
2. Click **"+ New Volume"**
3. Name: `lunao-data`
4. Mount path: `/data`
5. Click **Create**

### STEP 4: Set Environment Variables

Click your **app service** → **Variables** → Add these one by one:

```env
# ===== CORE =====
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8787
DATA_DIR=/data

# ===== SITE BASE URL =====
# IMPORTANT: Update this AFTER you generate the Railway domain (Step 5)
SITE_BASE_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-DOMAIN.up.railway.app
PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://YOUR-RAILWAY-DOMAIN.up.railway.app

# ===== TELNYX SMS (YOUR LIVE KEYS) =====
SMS_ENABLED=true
TELNYX_API_KEY=YOUR_TELNYX_API_KEY
TELNYX_PHONE_NUMBER=YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER
TELNYX_MESSAGING_PROFILE_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_PROFILE_ID

# ===== CLOUDFLARE PAGES (YOUR LIVE KEYS) =====
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_PROJECT=sms-bulk-pages
CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_BRANCH=main

# ===== AI FEATURES (Optional - leave blank for now) =====
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=

# ===== GOOGLE MAPS (Future - leave blank) =====
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=
```

### STEP 5: Generate Railway Domain

1. Click your **app service** → **Settings** → **Networking**
2. Click **"Generate Domain"**
3. You'll get something like: `https://lunao-api.up.railway.app`
4. **Go back to Variables** and update:
   - `SITE_BASE_URL` = `https://YOUR-DOMAIN.up.railway.app`
   - `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` = `https://YOUR-DOMAIN.up.railway.app`

### STEP 6: Wait for Deploy + Verify

1. Watch the **Build Logs** - should see:
   ```
   npm ci --include=dev
   npm run build
   node server/index.js
   Lunao pipeline API -> http://localhost:8787
   DB -> Postgres (Railway)
   ```

2. Once deployed, test the health endpoint:
   ```
   https://YOUR-DOMAIN.up.railway.app/api/health
   ```
   Expected response:
   ```json
   {"ok":true,"mode":{"telnyx":"LIVE","cloudflare":"LIVE","siteBaseUrl":"..."}}
   ```

---

## TELNYX WEBHOOK SETUP (CRITICAL FOR SMS)

1. Go to **https://portal.telnyx.com** → **Messaging** → **Webhooks**
2. Set **Inbound message URL** to:
   ```
   https://YOUR-DOMAIN.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/telnyx
   ```
3. Set **Outbound message status callback** to the same URL
4. Click **Save**

## RAILWAY RESOURCE SUMMARY

| Resource | Type | Purpose | Cost |
|----------|------|---------|------|
| **App Service** | Nixpacks (Node.js 20) | Express API + React frontend | ~$5-10/mo |
| **PostgreSQL** | Railway Postgres | All data (bookings, campaigns, SMS, credits) | ~$5-10/mo |
| **Volume** | Persistent Storage | Compiled sites survive restarts | FREE |

**Total: ~$10-20/month** (free tier covers light usage)

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After deployment, test every feature:

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://YOUR-DOMAIN.up.railway.app/api/health
```

### 2. Test SMS
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-DOMAIN.up.railway.app/api/test-sms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to":"+1YOUR_PHONE","text":"Hello from Railway!"}'
```

### 3. Test Campaign API
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-DOMAIN.up.railway.app/api/campaign/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"businesses":[{"name":"Test Salon","phone":"+1555","city":"NYC","niche":"salon"}],"niche":"salon","ownerKey":"test"}'
```

### 4. Check Credits System
```bash
curl https://YOUR-DOMAIN.up.railway.app/api/credits?ownerKey=test
```

### 5. Test Webhook (Simulate)
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-DOMAIN.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/telnyx \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_type":"message.delivered","payload":{"id":"test-123"}}'
```

## IF SOMETHING BREAKS

### App won't start?
- Check **Build Logs** - usually missing env vars
- Make sure `DATA_DIR=/data` is set (for volume mount)

### Database errors?
- Make sure PostgreSQL is linked to the app service
- Check `DATABASE_URL` is auto-injected

### SMS not sending?
- Verify `SMS_ENABLED=true`
- Verify Telnyx keys are correct
- Check Telnyx balance at portal.telnyx.com

### Sites not persisting?
- Make sure volume is mounted at `/data`
- Check `/data/sites` directory exists
